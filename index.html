    Farmers need resources to grow food. They need many different types of resources. 
    Farmers need natural resources, such as land,air, nutrients, water and sunlight.
    Farmers themselves need energy so they can work the land.
    Agriculture, with its allied sectors, is unquestionably the largest livelihood provider in India, 
    more so in the vast rural areas. It also contributes a significant figure to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
    Sustainable agriculture, in terms of food security, rural employment, and environmentally sustainable technologies such as
    soil conservation, sustainable natural resource management and biodiversity protection, are essential for holistic rural 
    development. Indian agriculture and allied activities have witnessed a green revolution, a white revolution, a yellow 
    revolution and a blue revolution.
    This section provides the information on agriculture produces; machineries, research etc. Detailed information
    on the government policies, schemes, agriculture loans, market prices, animal husbandry, fisheries, horticulture
    , loans & credit, sericulture etc. is also available.

    <br><br><br>
    
    <div class="techniquesTextHead">The latest techniques for farming in today's world are:</div>
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="techniquesText1">1. Aeroponics System<br><br>
    Aeroponics is the process where plants are grown in the air or mist environment without the use of soil. It is the subset of hydroponics, and suspends the plant root in the air to work. Farmers, by using this method will have better control over the amount of water to use.
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="techniquesText2">2. Aquaponics<br><br>
    Aquaponics is a closed-loop system that relies majorly on the symbiotic relationship between aquaculture and agriculture for fertilization. This farming method combines conventional aquaculture with hydroponics.
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="techniquesText3">3. Hydroponics<br><br>
    The hydroponics method is a less-soil type of farming, and it doesn't require any type of soil. The process involves growing healthy plants without the inclusion of solid medium using nutrients including water solution which is mineral-rich. Hydroponic farming is the subset of hydroculture, and the nutrients used in hydroponic farming systems have different sources.
    </div>
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="techniquesText4">4. Monoculture<br><br>
    This method is the raising of a single crop in a specific area of farming. However, in a country like India, the Monoculture technique of farming isn't widely followed. Indoor farming like growing medicinal plants falls under the monoculture. In plain words, monoculture is a modern agriculture practice where a single crop or plant is grown.

        <br><br>
        <div class="schemesText1">In order to make agriculture more productive, sustainable, remunerative and climate resilient, the Government of India introduced National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) in the year 2014-15. To achieve these goals, the mission promotes location specific sustainable and best farming practices; soil conservation and moisture protection measures; soil nutrient management; efficient and sustainable water management practices with mainstreaming rainfed methods.

        <div class="schemesText2">The Government of India has structured Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) with the vision to extend the coverage of irrigation and improving water use efficiency in a focused manner. PMKSY focuses end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, field application and extension activities. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had approved the irrigation scheme on July 1,, 2015.
        The Centre has structured the scheme with merging previous irrigation and water management programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) and On Farm Water Management (OFWM) scheme. The Centre has approved Rs. 50,000 crore for five years for the implementation of the flagship irrigation scheme across India.

        <br><br>
        <div class="schemesText3">With an objective of conserving and maintaining soil nutrient and soil fertility, Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme issues soil health cards to the farmers every two years to provide a basis to address nutritional deficiencies in the fields. Under the scheme, soil testing is conducted to analyse the nutrient needs, then crop-wise fertilisers are recommended accordingly. This reduces cultivation cost by application of right fertilisers with right quantity.
        In the next five years, the Centre has targeted to cover 400,000 villages under individual farm holding soil sampling and testing, organise 2.5 lakh demonstrations, set up of 250 village level soil testing labs, strengthening 200 soil testing labs and promotion of micro-nutrients in two lakh hectare area.

    <br><br><br>
    <div class="awarenessTextHead">The following are the bills related to farming present in India:</div>
    <br><br><br>
    
        <div class="awarenessText1">The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020
        <br><br>
        At present, the Indian farmers face difficulties because of various restrictions, including limitations to selling their commodities only to the state government's registered licensees and prohibition on selling produce outside the notified APMC market yards. Along with this, due to prevalence of various APMC laws, by the state governments, there are hinderances in the free flow of agricultural trade between states.
        The new bill seeks to build an environment wherein farmers and traders can enjoy the freedom of choice regarding selling and purchasing of produce; this will facilitate remunerative prices through competitive, alternative trading channels to promote efficient, open and barrier-free interstate and intrastate trade.
        </div>
        <br><br><br>

        <div class="awarenessText2">The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020
        <br><br>
        With an aim to transform the agriculture sector, The new bill seeks to provide a national agricultural agreement system that protects and empowers farmers to interact equally and transparently with agribusiness companies, processors, wholesalers, exporters or major retailers in the field of agricultural services and sell future agricultural produce at mutually agreed remunerative price structures.
        This law would shift the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor and allow the farmer to access new technologies and better inputs. It will reduce the marketing costs and increase farmers' earnings. Farmers can participate in direct marketing so that the intermediaries are eliminated, resulting in maximum price realisation. Through this bill, farmers have been given adequate protection, and with clear timelines for redress, an efficient dispute resolution process has been established.
        </div>
        <br><br><br>

        <div class="awarenessText3">The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020
        <br><br>
        The new bill aims to exclude items—from the list of essential commodities—such as cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onions, and potatoes. This will alleviate concerns of undue regulatory intervention by private investors in their business operations. The ability to grow, keep, transport, distribute and supply will harness the economies of scale and draw direct private sector/foreign investment into the agricultural sector.
        The law would help accelerate investments in cold storage and food supply chain modernisation. It will benefit farmers and customers alike, while at the same time bring in price stability. It would create a favourable business climate and avoid wastage of agri products due to the lack of storage facilities.
